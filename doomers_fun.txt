Prophet Pollo sees: you die under collapsed pallet racking, labeled “employee error.”
Your future: crushed by overstock, ghost still clocked in.
Death by shrink-wrap suffocation, soul billed as damage.
Forklift flips, your blood counts as spill kit practice.
Final scan: “Employee not found—disposed as obsolete.”
You slip on oil, skull cracks; WMS logs “product loss.”
Buried in the bulk reserve, epitaph: “Wrong location.”
Heart stops mid-pick; body left till cycle count notices.
Crate falls, pins you; safety meeting blames headphones.
Eternal shift: damned to push an empty pallet in the dark.
We are all just inventory in the end
Velocity is a social construct
The warehouse is a tomb
Nothing ever sells, everything rots
Forecast: pain
Your top mover is still not enough
The rooster knows your sins
Buy more, cry less
Dead stock = eternal shame
The Prophet has seen the heat death of retail
